Swift and stdlib suitable for firmware / bare metal coding


This repo is a fork of the apple/swift used for building [swift-project1]
(https://github.com/spevans/swift-project1) and contains three main changes:

1. A `-disable-red-zone` compiler option to `swiftc` to compile code without
   using the red zone


2. A `-mcode-model` compiler option so that the `kernel` code model can be
   used.

3. Stdlib has been modified to remove:

- All floating point types `(Float32/Float64)` and code

- Math functions and some extra IO calls that are only needed for unix userland
programs.

This allows stdlib to be compiled without using SSE registers or instructions
to while still conforming to the x86_64 ABI


A new branch is created each time the changes are rebased onto the latest swift
upstream master so that the changes are kept at the top of the commits, and to
make it easier to use an older version. The build script creates a tgz based on
the date to maintain multiple versions.

NOTE: The master branch is not always updated with the latest change so its best
to just use the latest swift-kernel-YYYYMMDD branch if building from source or
download a prebuilt tgz which is designed to work on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04).

This will probably have problems building on MacOS as Objective-C support will
be compiled in which will only get in the way



The [kernel-lib](https://github.com/spevans/swift/tree/kernel-lib)
branch can be cloned from https://github.com/spevans/swift.git The other repos

```

This will install a compiler and stdlib in `~/swift-kernel`


Because of the code removed from Stdlib, no tests can be run on the build and
Foundation cannot be built either.

SDK overlays are also not built as these use OS provided functions that arent
applicable or would need to be emulated.

When compiling .swift files use the following arguments to disable red zone and
SSE

`-Xfrontend -disable-red-zone -Xcc -mno-red-zone -Xcc -mno-mmx -Xcc -mno-sse -Xcc -mno-sse2`

Then link with `~/swift-kernel/usr/lib/swift_static/linux/{libswiftCore.a,libswiftSectionDataStatic.a}`
